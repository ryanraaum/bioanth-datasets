Total energy expenditure and mass data as tabulated in Pontzer et al. 2014, 
doi:10.1073/pnas.1316940111
- renamed the admixed Eulemur sp. as Eulemur
- dropped the second Peromyscus maniculatus data point 
  (which was not used in primate - nonprimate comparisons in Pontzer et al.)
- mass is in kg
- tee is total energy expenditure in kcalories/day

Tree from Binida-Emonds et al. 2007, doi:10.1038/nature05634
- this is the same source as used in phylogenetic analyses in Pontzer et al. 
- reduced to taxa shared with the Pontzer et al. data
- Euleumur fulvus used as the tip for the admixed Eulemur group
- Proteles_cristatus renamed to Proteles_cristata
- Homo_sapiens renamed to Homo_sapiens_Hadza
  (to use the Hadza as the human data point)
