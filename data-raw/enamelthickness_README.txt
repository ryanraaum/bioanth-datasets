Enamel thickness and other molar data as tabulated in Skinner et al. 2015, 
doi:10.1016/j.jhevol.2015.03.012

The data includes 9 columns:
- accession
- taxon
- tooth: mandibular molar M1, M2, M3
- enamel_area: in mm squared
- dentine_area: in mm squared
- edj_length: enamel-dentine junction length in mm
- bcd: bi-cervical diameter in mm
- aet: average enamel thickness in mm
- ret: relative enamel thickness

The data were extracted from the supplementary material. The following modifications
were made:
- citation and basis for tooth identification columns dropped
- consolidated LM1 and RM1 into just M1, and the same for M2 and M3; none of the
  analyses in the paper itself differentiate between right and left
- fixed an apparent error in the values for bcd, aet, and ret for the specimens of 
  unknown taxonomic attribution (column values were rotated)
